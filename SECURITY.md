Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via:

1. **Email**: security@aibughunter.com
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Security" tab in this repository
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Contact us for PGP key if needed

### **What to Include**

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of security issue is it?
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction Steps**: How can we reproduce the issue?
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### **Response Timeline**

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

### **Application Security**

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms
- Session management with appropriate timeouts
- Role-based access control (user/admin)

#### **Input Validation**
- Comprehensive input sanitization for all user inputs
- File upload restrictions (type, size, content validation)
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through output encoding

#### **Data Protection**
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Secure transmission over HTTPS only
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Database connection security

### **Infrastructure Security**

#### **API Security**
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Request size limits to prevent DoS
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

#### **Code Analysis Security**
- Sandboxed execution environment for code analysis
- File type validation and content scanning
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Temporary file cleanup and secure deletion

### **Third-Party Integrations**

#### **Payment Security (Stripe)**
- PCI DSS compliant payment processing
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure API key management
- No storage of payment card data

#### **Email Security (MailChimp)**
- API key protection and rotation capability
- Rate limiting for email sending
- Input validation for email content
- Bounce and spam monitoring

## 🚧 Security Considerations for Users

### **For Developers Using the Platform**

#### **Code Upload Security**
- **Review Before Upload**: Never upload code containing real credentials
- **Sanitize Sensitive Data**: Remove API keys, passwords, database URLs
- **Use Test Data**: Upload sample code, not production code
- **Check Analysis Results**: Review suggestions before implementing

#### **Account Security**
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Regular Review**: Monitor your account activity regularly
- **Secure Networks**: Only access from trusted networks
- **Logout Properly**: Always log out from shared devices

### **For Administrators**

#### **Environment Security**
- **Secure .env Files**: Never commit environment files to version control
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- **Access Control**: Limit admin access to necessary personnel only
- **Monitoring**: Monitor admin actions and API usage

#### **Deployment Security**
- **HTTPS Only**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
- **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers
- **Database Security**: Secure MongoDB with authentication and encryption
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation

## 🔍 Security Testing

### **Automated Security Scanning**

We regularly perform:
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitor third-party packages for vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Cloud security posture management

### **Manual Security Testing**

Regular security assessments include:
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks on the application
- **Code Reviews**: Manual review of security-critical code
- **Authentication Testing**: Verification of auth mechanisms
- **Input Validation Testing**: Comprehensive input fuzzing

## 🛠️ Security Development Practices

### **Secure Coding Standards**
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
